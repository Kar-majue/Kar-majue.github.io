  abstract = {This study presents the development of a cost-and-effect simulation model tailored for evaluating urban planning strategies within the compact city framework in Japan. Comprising three fundamental modules and five sub-models, the model integrates pseudo-people-flow data to simulate and predict urban metrics such as population, administrative costs, visitors, and traffic volume from 2015 to 2040. Four scenarios, including baseline, location optimization, new road installation, and new station installation, were analyzed to uncover the differential impacts of urban planning decisions. Findings suggest that 1) the new station project could relieve the future population decrease, 2) the location optimization and new station projects contribute to improving the efficiency of public services and future sustainability, 3) urban vitality could be enhanced by the new station construction that generates a new urban core, and 4) compact city policy may have a positive effect on sustainable city development by decreasing and concentrating traffic volume, and shorten trips by car. The model's efficiency and uncertainty was examined. The user experiment highlights the potential of digital tools to democratize urban planning, making it accessible for non-expert stakeholder engagement and informed participation. This research contributes to the use of technology in participatory urban planning.}

  abstract = {In response to the declining population and aging infrastructure in Japan, local governments are implementing compact city policies in the form of location normalization plans. To optimize the reorganization of urban public infrastructure, it is important to provide detailed and accurate forecasts of the distribution of urban populations and households. However, several local governments do not have the necessary data and forecasting capability. Moreover, current forecasts of gender- and age-based population data only exist at the municipal level, and household data are exclusively available by family type at the prefecture level. Meanwhile, the accuracy is limited with an assumption of the same rate of change of population in all municipalities and within each city. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an agent-based microsimulation household transition model, with the household as the unit and agent. Household data was estimated for all cities in Japan from 2015. Estimated household data comprised of family type, house type, and address, age, and gender of household members, obtained from the national census, and building data. The resulting household transition model was used to forecast the attributes of each household every five years. Simulations in Toyama and Shizuoka Prefectures, Japan from 1980 to 2010 provided highly accurate estimates of municipal-level population by age and household volume by family type. The proposed model was further applied to predict the future distribution of disappearing villages and vacant houses in Japan.}

  pages={69486-69494},
  abstract={Prediction of accurate wind speed is necessary for a variety of applications such as energy production, agriculture, climate modeling, and weather forecasting. Various satellites orbiting the earth measure the wind speed, which is particularly useful as they provide measurements of wind speed over large areas and in remote locations that might be difficult to measure using other methods. However, satellite-based wind speed measurements have relatively low spatial resolution compared to other methods, such as ground-based radar. In this research, we develop WindSR and a lightweight tiny-WindSR to improve the resolution of satellite wind speed data by four times from the NASA’s GEOS-5 Nature Run dataset. WindSR has SRResNet-based architecture consisting of several Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks to compute features from low spatial resolution (28 km) wind speed for upscaling. We train WindSR with more than 20,000 pairs of low-resolution (28 km) and corresponding high-resolution (7 km) wind speed data and evaluate its performance on the validation set consisting of 2,102 wind speed images. Experimental results show that WindSR outperforms classical upsampling algorithms, such as Bicubic interpolation and Lanczos interpolation by 17.89% and general-purpose super-resolution GANs such as BSRGAN and SwinIR by up to 11.35% on the RMSE metric. The dataset developed in this research is publicly available at: https://github.com/sekilab/WindSR_Dataset.},

  abstract={In recent years, cities are heavily investing in visual identity and its image. Literature revealed art has been used as a tool to escalate the city image by improving visual quality. This paper present of identifying the role of art in raising city image in the context of youth perception. The paper engages a case study in &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Kampung Pelangi&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, Semarang city. Likewise to response to the rapid change of urban city, Semarang city was attempted to paint the slum area becomes more colorful and attractive. Thus, potentially brought an impact to the overall visual quality in the city. The online questionnaire was used and collected 78 respondens. The study employs a combination of statistics and descriptive analysis. The variety of statistical analysis performed to examined the significant correlation. The multiple linear regression analysis showed the significant variable on a longer period of stay whereas lack of evidence for other related variables. Moreover, the correlation analysis was used to examined the hypothesis in chi-square test. The result obtained significant correlation was showed art element in &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Kampung Pelangi&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; potential to escalate image in a district scale although lack of evidence to indicate that art in &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Kampung Pelangi&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; could contributes to raising the image of Semarang city. Additionally, the study allows to generated conceptual matrix on the relationship of public art (publicity) and city image (imageability) towards spatial sustainability. The study is limit in one type of sample, and a small number of respondent might affect the result.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keywords: Public art; city image; youth perception; imageability&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;eIPH-AbstractCopyright&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;eISSN&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; 2398-4295 Â© 2019.
