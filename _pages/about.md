I am currently a project researcher immersed in the innovative field of [Human Centered Urban Informatics](https://sekilab.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) at the [Center for Spatial Information Science (CSIS), University of Tokyo](https://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). I received my Ph.D. degree from [Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo](http://www.civil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) in 2023. 

At the heart of my work lies a passion for marrying the precision of digital planning support tools with the insights afforded by GIS and the predictive power of urban simulation. I am deeply committed to forging new pathways in data-driven methodologies, all aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of urban planning and design processes.

Beyond the technical facets of my research, I harbor a keen interest in the principles of sustainable development and the advocacy for compact city policies. I believe in creating urban environments that are not only technologically advanced but also sustainable and conducive to human well-being.

As I navigate the intersection of technology and urban systems, I invite you to join me in exploring innovative solutions that shape the cities of tomorrow.
