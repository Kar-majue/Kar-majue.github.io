<!-- <p>Digital Twin | City Science  |  GIS & Urban Planning  |  Civil Engineering </p> -->

I am currently a Project Researcher at the [Center for Spatial Information Science (CSIS), University of Tokyo](https://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), primarily focusing on [Human Centered Urban Informatics](https://sekilab.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo](http://www.civil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) in 2023. 

My research interests lie in the impact of digital tools on urban development and how these tools can foster citizen participation. Currently, my work revolves around the development of a digital twin platform and the application of generative AI methodologies in the field of urban planning. 

Additionally, I am deeply concerned with demographic changes and compact city policies in the context of population decline and aging, as well as the sustainable development of future cities.

I am very open to research collaboration. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me!
